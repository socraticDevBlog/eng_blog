I was listening to a podcast during my daily walk and came across an idea discussed by the hosts. It's a podcast related to soft skills in the technology world, and the hosts, with decades of experience in this field, share ideas that are both funny and enlightening.

It's about the "trust battery" analogy. This analogy explains how both fruitful
and frustrating relationships can develop between two colleagues. Instead of
focusing on people or the nature of tasks, this analogy illustrates that the
quality of interpersonal relationships depends on each interaction between two
colleagues; how they stack up. Everyone starts with a battery charged at 50%. Based on the
results of these interactions, the battery either charges or drains.

Immediately, for me, this analogy illuminates two important aspects of the quality of interpersonal relationships at work.

First, this analogy emphasizes the relationship rather than the people. What makes certain collaborations frustrating comes from the quality of the relationship. Any reflection on people's value and competence can be avoided.

Next, by characterizing the relationship first rather than the person, the
trust battery analogy brings important nuances when talking about interpersonal
frustration at work. By emphasizing the quality of the relationship rather than
the people, it becomes clearer that a person at work can have extremely
pleasant and productive relationships with certain people while others
experience significant frictions with.
