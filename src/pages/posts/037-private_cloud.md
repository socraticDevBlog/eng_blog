If you have a large volume of data or if you require a certain level of security for your documents, the use of a ``NAS`` (network attached storage) could meet your needs. Hosting a large volume of data in the cloud is expensive. Storing unencrypted documents in the public cloud is risky.

> How can you be sure your data are safe on a public cloud service?

Local area network storage is essential for businesses and large organizations. In order to streamline work, we store and make available any document essential to the proper functioning of business. Most of the time, this storage comes in the form of an additional drive available on your PC when you are connected to the internal company network. Users usually maintain a rigorous order there, system administrators manage the various read and write permissions, and an automated system performs a regular backup of all data.

##### why have a ``NAS`` at home?

Different needs motivate the use of a ``NAS`` at home. Many movie collectors a ``NAS`` to store their collection and other digital content. By adding a ``RAID`` redundancy system, they ensure protection against defective hard disks.

Me? I use a ``NAS`` because it offers a centralized source of data. Since I am working from multiple computers, file duplication had become problematic. Thanks to the ``NAS``, I can access the same file through any device connected to the local network.

##### weigh the pros and cons

against :
- It is easier to centralize your data by using disk space in the public cloud such as ``dropbox`` or ``Google drive``;
- Local area storage does not work well for those who work on the road or outside the home;
- A `NAS` requires additional administration efforts: update, backup, etc.

for :
- Getting a large storage space at low cost;
- Managing and safe-keeping your personal data yourself;
- Encrypting all your personal data (strongly suggested);
- Data transfer rates on a local network are around 100 mb / s, there is almost no difference between loading a file located on your PC than the same live file on the ``NAS``;
- Reducing your ecological footprint: a small ``NAS`` running under Linux consumes almost no electricity.

##### strategy for keeping your data

1. Keep all your files on the ``NAS``. Do not keep copies on different workstations;
2. Classify and keep your files in order;
3. Make regular backups: any valuable file should exist in 3 copies. A current version on your ``NAS``, a copy in a backup stored on another machine. A third copy, encrypted, stored in the public cloud (or on a hard drive located elsewhere than your home);
4. Encrypt the entire hard drive. Modern ``NAS`` are powerful enough to encrypt and decrypt your data on the fly without losing performance.

##### conclusion

Using a ``NAS`` is not a magic cure but a valuable tool to make your digital life easier. Installing and administering such a system will take time, but will prove beneficial.
