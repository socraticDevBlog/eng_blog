This new blog post builds on a previous popular article where we provided guidance to job seekers on excelling in interviews ([A Short Guide to the Perfect Job Seeker](https://en.socratic.dev/a-short-guide-to-the-perfect-job-seeker/)).

A key part of your interview preparation is assessing whether the jobs you're applying to truly align with your career goals and personal ambitions.

Simply reading the job posting carefully isn’t enough. We recommend using an AI assistant, like ChatGPT, to help you analyze and interpret the posting more effectively.

Behind the scenes, HR teams work with hiring managers and senior team members to compile a list of role requirements. Often, this ends up as a “shopping list” of tasks the team has handled in the past, which may seem straightforward at first glance. However, using this list to draw inferences and comparing them with your own goals can provide a clearer, more realistic picture of the role.

### LLM Prompts - What Questions Should I Ask My AI Assistant?

1. Download the job posting as a PDF
2. In the AI prompt textbox, explain your job preferences and professional ambitions, and ask the AI to review the job posting (by uploading the PDF) and look for:

   - Discrepancies between the role title and the listed duties
   - Possible red flags between the role title, duties, and your career goals
   - An overall assessment of the role’s suitability

### Testing the Experiment

How reliable is an LLM for this purpose?

Try these prompts for a role you know well. If there’s an open position in a team you’re familiar with at your current company, use the posting and run these prompts. Chances are, the AI’s interpretation will closely match the reality of the role.
