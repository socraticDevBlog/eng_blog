SaltStack is a high-speed platform for provisioning and controlling distributed computing resources. ``Salt Cloud`` is a configuration management tool that allows users to provision systems on cloud hosts or hypervisors. During installation, ``Salt Cloud`` installs ``Salt`` on all provisioned systems by default. This enables the user to put systems into the desired state during provisioning. 

``Salt`` was released in November 2011 and LinkedIn dev teams were the first major early adopter.

> ``Salt`` is a configuration management engine to provide idempotent application of machine states to those hosts.

I became aware of ``Salt`` via [The Hacks](https://www.saltstack.com/the-hacks/): a nerdy podcast hosted by Salt's founder Thomas Hatch and Jimmy Chonga, a tech newbie and former morning radio host.

Being a software and fullstack web dev, I've asked a devops pro about _Salt_ and he told be it's ['based'](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Based). He had experience with it by helping an organization setup their infrastructure and he was pleased with the product.

> ``SaltStack`` makes software for complex systems management at scale. ``SaltStack`` is the company that created and maintains the ``Salt`` Open project and develops and sells _SaltStack Enterprise software_, services and support. Easy enough to get running in minutes, scalable enough to manage tens of thousands of servers, and fast enough to communicate with them in seconds.

> ``Salt`` is a new approach to infrastructure management built on a dynamic communication bus. ``Salt`` can be used for data-driven orchestration, remote execution for any infrastructure, configuration management for any app stack, and much more.

``Salt`` viable alternatives are ``Chef``, ``Puppet``, and ``Ansible``. 

However, adopters usually become die-hard fans of the product. One CTO stresses ``Salt`` was the best product to manage his large scale ``Windows Server`` based infrastructure. Easy maintenance is guaranteed mainly thru "a good reporting mechanism that allows one to easily view all operations". 

When compared to competitors, ``Salt`` is the way to go if __scalability__ and __resilience__ is the most important concern for your organization.
