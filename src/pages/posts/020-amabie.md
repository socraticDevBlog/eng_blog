Who did say: ``If a disease spreads, show a picture of me to those who fall ill and they will be healed`` ?

Amabie (アマビエ) is a legendary Japanese mermaid or merman with three legs, who allegedly emerges from the sea and prophesies either an abundant harvest or an epidemic. 

##### a Legend

An amabie appeared in the province of Higo (prefecture of Kumamoto) according to legend, around the middle of the fourth month, in the year Kōka 3 (mid-May 1846) at the time of Edo. A bright object had been spotted in the sea for several nights. The city official went to the coast to investigate and saw the friend. According to the sketch made by this official, she had long hair, a mouth like a bird's beak, was covered with scales up to the neck and had three legs. Addressing the official, she identified herself as a friend and told him that she lived on the high seas. She then delivered a prophecy: "There will be a good harvest for six years from the year in run; if a disease spreads, show a picture of me to those who fall ill and they will be healed. " Then she returned to the sea. The story was printed in a kawaraban (a printed bulletin), with her portrait, and that is how the story spread to Japan.

##### The COVID-19 mascot in Japan

During the COVID-19 epidemic, amabie became a popular topic on Twitter in Japan. Manga artists (e.g. Chica Umino, Mari Okazaki and Toshinao Aoki) published their cartoon versions of amabie on social networks. The Twitter account of Orochi Do, an art shop specializing in hanging scrolls of yōkai, is said to have been the first, tweeting "a new coronavirus countermeasure" in late February 2020.
