Reading the history of Cambyses II’s reign up until the rise of Darius sheds light on the dangers of absolute power wielded by a single man—and the harmful consequences it brings, especially for those around him.

The brief reign of Cambyses II, king of the Persians from 530 to 522 BCE, illustrates the excesses of power exercised without oversight or accountability. Son of Cyrus II, Cambyses conquered Egypt in 525 BCE, founding the 27th dynasty. This conquest was marked by extreme brutality. Offended by the resistance of King Psammenitus, Cambyses had his children massacred and humiliated the people, forcing them to march as slaves with nooses around their necks. He also desecrated Egyptian tombs as an act of revenge.

But his ambition didn’t stop there. He launched three military expeditions, all doomed to fail. The first was abandoned when his Phoenician fleet refused to attack Carthage. The second ended in tragedy: attempting to conquer Ethiopia, Cambyses sent an army without preparation or supplies, forcing his soldiers to resort to cannibalism. Finally, an army sent to attack the sanctuary of Ammon vanished in the desert, reportedly engulfed by a sandstorm, according to the Ammonians.

The end of Cambyses’ reign was marked by madness. Amused by blaspheming local religious beliefs, he allegedly fatally wounded the Apis bull, a sacred Egyptian deity, and ordered the assassination of both his brother and sister.

The Greek historian Herodotus presents the “conspiracy of the seven,” in which seven Persian nobles, including Darius, slaughter the usurpers of the Persian throne—a founding moment that sparks a political awakening. After years of injustice and misfortune, the conspirators finally take time to reflect on the best form of government. They all agree on one point: never again should they submit to the rule of a single man who can act as he pleases without being held accountable. In any case, pride, personal gain, and reckless haste are the hallmarks of such a political situation.

Herodotus’s account of the “conspiracy of the seven” highlights a rare but valuable idea: that of decisive and discreet action. Unlike Cambyses, portrayed as a madman driven by impulse, the six original conspirators act with caution and in secrecy. Darius, the seventh, takes the lead of the plan, convinced it would be dangerous to wait any longer—and even riskier to include more participants in the plot. He knows that even acting as a group of seven is already risky: the wider the circle, the more fragile the secrecy. Action, to be effective, must be both slow and swift.

This same strategic wisdom is echoed in a saying used by an elite American military unit:
“Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.”
