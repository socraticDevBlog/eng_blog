At the end of the day last Friday, the OpenAI board of directors surprised the world
technology by firing their CEO Sam Altman.

Sam Altman is a charismatic American entrepreneur working in the world of
tech startups and financing through venture capital investment
(venture capitalism).

His goal with OpenAI was to `package` artificial intelligence to put it in the
hands of the general public.

OpenAI is a non-profit organization known as the world leader in
artificial intelligence. The ChatGPT `chatbot` was notably developed by
them.

> "ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a
> large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on
> November 30, 2022, that enables users to refine and steer a conversation
> towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.
> Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered
> at each conversation stage as a context."

### incredible sequence of events

**Friday November 17**, the dismissal of Sam Altman surprised the entire community because
Altman is a character appreciated by all and having clearly not committed
no serious one.

**Saturday, November 18**, the council recused itself and requested the return of Altman.

**Sunday November 19**, Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) announces on X(twitter)
the arrival of Sam Altman at the Redmond giant.

**Monday November 20**, a majority of OpenAI employees (scientists
specialized in artificial intelligence), in a public letter, requested the
dissolution of the board of directors and threatened to leave to join Sam
Altman at Microsoft.

### concrete conclusions

Microsoft becomes the dominant player in artificial intelligence.

Sam Altman, representing people who want to accelerate the development of
artificial intelligence, brilliantly resisted the poorly prepared attack of
remainder of the board of directors; especially from its principal researcher Ilya
Sustskever.

### "philosophical" conclusions

The OpenAI saga of the weekend before Thanksgiving demonstrates how idealism
can blind people with some power. In order to reach one's goal, pragmatic
realism and mastery of politics, strategy and diplomacy is paramount.

I use the term idealist to describe the members of the council
OpenAI admin. To emphasize their disconnection with reality and,
above all, the arrogance of banking on a `coup` to advance their agenda.

The council was caught in the act of self-sabotage. They lost the
confidence of a large part of their employees and have become patsies in the tech community.

With OpenAI and the firing of Sam Altman, the Board of Directors has
probably lacked prudence and judgment.
