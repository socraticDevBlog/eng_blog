# Part three - Midnight in the rue Jules-Verne

The third and last part of William Gibson's _Neuromancer_ starts on page 101
and ends on page 271. The whole crew leaves Earth and flies toward _Freeside_:
a Man built exclave orbiting the Earth. Every member of Armitage's
cherry-picked crew is there for a reason. A specific skill set, or a destiny.

## Chapter 8 - welcome to Zion

En route to _Freeside_ they stop on Zion. A space station colonized by relaxed
Rastafarians. In fact the founding fathers were construction workers hired to
build a "gravity tunnel" between _Freeside_ and Earth, but escaped the toil to
build their own little paradise above Earth.

Armitage, Molly, Case and Riviera stays in Zion for 80 hours to get used to zero gravity. In a
space that smells cooked vegetables and ganja. Dub is always playing as
background music. Molly says it's about "worship", a sense of "community".

Despite being a cowboy working in cyberspace, Case still needs to be physically
at ease. Zero gravity makes him secrete more adrenaline. Which is bad.

He suffers from `SAS`: Space Adaptation Syndrome. A kind of motion sickness
experienced when travelling to zero gravity conditions.

In this chapter we get to see more of Riviera's antics. He is a joker who uses
his skills to surrounds himself by weird holograms: a snake around his arm or
spermatozoids in Case's drink.
