# Part three - Midnight in the rue Jules-Verne

The third and last part of William Gibson's _Neuromancer_ starts on page 101
and ends on page 271. The whole crew leaves Earth and flies toward _Freeside_:
a Man built exclave orbiting the Earth. Every member of Armitage's
cherry-picked crew is there for a reason. A specific skill set, or a destiny.

## Chapter 8 - welcome to Zion

En route to _Freeside_ they stop on Zion. A space station colonized by relaxed
Rastafarians. In fact the founding fathers were construction workers hired to
build a "gravity tunnel" between _Freeside_ and Earth, but escaped the toil to
build their own little paradise above Earth.

Armitage, Molly, Case and Riviera stays in Zion for 80 hours to get used to zero gravity. In a
space that smells cooked vegetables and ganja. Dub is always playing as
background music. Molly says it's about "worship", a sense of "community".

Despite being a cowboy working in cyberspace, Case still needs to be physically
at ease. Zero gravity makes him secrete more adrenaline. Which is bad.

He suffers from `SAS`: Space Adaptation Syndrome. A kind of motion sickness
experienced when travelling to zero gravity conditions.

In this chapter we get to see more of Riviera's antics. He is a joker who uses
his skills to surrounds himself by weird holograms: a snake around his arm or
spermatozoids in Case's drink.

## Chapter 9 - grappling with Wintermute

"Maelcum transports Case and Molly from Zion to Freeside on his ship, the
_Marcus Garvey_."

During the flight, Case first connect to Dixie in order to ask him more
questions about Wintermute. Dixie recalls having met an AI (artificial
intelligence) owned by Tessier-Ashpool. It was in Rio. Not in Berne, like for
Wintermute. Dixie warns him that such an encounter can be lethal.

Nevertheless, Dixie and Case travel to Switzerland in the cyberspace. Case
witnesses Wintermute: a cube made out of light. A distinct shape appeared
from the cube. A gray face. Dixie ordered Case to disconnect. But it was
too late.

Case experienced a serie of hallucinations while his body, still in the ship
traveling to Freeside, beside Molly, was flatlining (clinically dead).

He met his former girlfriend, Linda, in an arcade.

Then at his friend Julius Deane's office, he met Wintermute. Wintermute took
the traits of Julie. Wintermute admits having used Linda to communicate with
him.

Wintermute explains its goal. As an AI it is seeking more autonomy. It is using
Armitage and his crew for this.

About Armitage, Wintermute warns Case that he is about to burn out. Armitage is
only a shell around a severely mentally ill person.

Before leaving, Case shot Wintermute/Julie in the face with their own gun.

## Chapter 10 - Freeside, rue Jules-Verne

Case and Molly arrive to Freeside. Molly takes care of customs.

> "Customs, for Freeside, consisted mainly of proving your credit"

Still sick from SAS, Case goes to sleep. He dreamed about a teenage love. In the
dream, he used a flame thrower to destroy a wasp nest. He noticed the nest was
stamped by the Tessier-Ashpool logo.

The author offers a rich description of this artificial exclave orbiting the Earth. Fake
sky, fake sun, fake trees, etc.

Case goes out shopping for a space vacuum-suit.

After analyzing a computer virus handed by Malcaeum. He uses his Osaka computer
then he connects to Dixie to ask for his help.

Before returning to the hotel, Case gets hold of stimulant drugs that can
bypass his new pancreas filter. He gets really high and, back at the hotel,
Molly is very disapointed. She warns him of the aftermath of such a drug strong
enough to bypass his pancreas blockers.

## Chapter 11 - focus on Riviera and Molly

Case woke up with a hangover. Molly and Armitage noticed his recent excess. But
Case tries to hide it and blames an allergic reaction to the unusual food
served on Freeside.

Armitage, Molly and Case goes to a cabaret to assist to Riviera holographic
show: "The Doll". 

> "Riviera’s performance is designed to be disturbing and titillating, intended to capture the attention of 3Jane, a member of the Tessier Ashpool family, whose tastes Armitage, Wintermute, and Riviera have explored. However, Riviera also intends to disturb and offend his coworkers—specifically Molly who he seems to lust after but also resent. Although not technically real, his show is disturbing, and creates real emotions of disgust and distress in Case and Molly."

Molly disappears from the cabaret. Case returns to hotel and has another
encounter with Wintermute.

Case finally gets an address for where to find Molly. She's in a cubicule
coffin located in the basement of a nightclub. Case shows up at the front desk
to realize it's a kind of brothel. He rents a cubicle near Molly's. Instead of
settling into his unit, he knocks at Molly's door.

Molly discloses her past as a sex doll. A sex doll is a woman who
rents her body without being conscious of her encounters. A "cut-off chip" is
implanted in her brain to prevent the doll of being conscious while being on
duty. Molly's chip was likely tampered with when she got metal blades implanted
in lieu of nails. Once she became conscious of being beaten up by a client. A
major political man. She woke up and killed him.

This is the reason Molly is always on the run. Escaping her former employer.

Case and Molly concludes Wintermute is putting them into situations to trigger
hatred; to manipulate them.

> "She thinks Wintermute somehow set up his show, so that she would hate Riviera and be motivated to go in to Straylight after him. She tells Case she’s going to kill Riviera. Case tells Molly about the Lonny Zone and Linda Lee. Molly wonders if Wintermute is trying to get him to hate something, too. "

## chapter 12 - Turing police. 
In the last chapter of _Part three - Midnight in the Rue Jules-Verne_, Case
reflects on his addiction to drugs; his reflex to numbing himself.

He meets his new friend and drug soulmate Cath at a bar. She talks about 3Jane
and her bodyguard. 3Jane is an heiress to the family Tessier-Ashpool. Cath
presents a _derm_ containing Case's new favorite substance.

Case walks around while being high. Back to his hotel room, he is met by "two
men and a woman -- the Turing police.

> "Turing," she said. "You are under arrest."
