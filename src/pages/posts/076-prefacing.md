What I want to emphasize here is the collective awareness by social networks
users of this communication strategy: _prefacing_. It seems that Internet users
notice more the use of preambles in communications. Above all, those with which they disagree.

“Prefacing” means to introduce one’s point with additional informations intended to put the listener in
context. However, this communication maneuver has recently acquired a negative
connotation in social media, particularly on X (formerly Twitter).

Less often used to enrich the topic, the _preface_ has become a strategy
to discourage dialogue or even simply refuse it.

### prefacing examples

- "**I am not someone who likes to play politics**, but we must
  absolutely tackle the problem of hiring a certain type of profile
  in our universities"
- "**In fact**, the publication of blogs should be reserved for organizations
  official rather than amateurs like SocraticDev"

### the use of the verb “prefacing”

Prefacing is an interesting element of our daily communication. Like paying
attention to non-verbal cues, I encourage myself to add this aspect to my
routine of [reading the
room](https://socratic.dev/reading-the-room-est-un-soft-skill) for enrich
my understanding of any social situation.

Analogue to fallacies, prefacing could be used as unfair tactics to stifle dialogue; a non-rational act aimed at
imposing a balance of power, for example.

### conclusion

I want to "postface" by emphasizing that I was not aware of
the use of the word “prefacing” until recently. I
sympathizes with the detractors of this tactic while demonstrating
measure.

Establishing a common ground between the speaker and the audience is
fundamental for successful communication.

The notion of _ethos_ (the character of the speaker) is part of the art of
rhetoric. Will we rebel because a speaker takes the
time to present their personal story before diving into their speech?

For my part, I am happily adding this aspect to my critical thinker's toolbox. While keeping myself from using this new notion to help me
rebel me further. (╯°□°）╯︵
