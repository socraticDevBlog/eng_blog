(updated with new words: garbo) 
 
Youth always had its own private language. In my younger days, I remember moving to a new city and discovering kids my age used an array of unknown expressions to me. Quick! Better learn them fast. A common language defines a community and offers a feeling of belonging. Nowadays the community is global and youth shares thru Internet a common idiom older folks don't understand. 

And they couldn't care less.

> "Is it because the witness expresses himself so badly? There is another explanation. It's not because, uneasy, he poorly expresses himself that you don't understand him; it is because you won't understand him that he expresses himself so poorly."
> <cite>-- Elie Wiesel, foreword to "Night"(1960)</cite>

In online animation drawings in the manosphere, a Chad is further tagged with the last name Thundercock and is often depicted as muscular with a very pronounced crotch bulge.
