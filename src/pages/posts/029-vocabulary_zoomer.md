(updated with new words: garbo) 
 
Youth always had its own private language. In my younger days, I remember moving to a new city and discovering kids my age used an array of unknown expressions to me. Quick! Better learn them fast. A common language defines a community and offers a feeling of belonging. Nowadays the community is global and youth shares thru Internet a common idiom older folks don't understand. 

And they couldn't care less.

> "Is it because the witness expresses himself so badly? There is another explanation. It's not because, uneasy, he poorly expresses himself that you don't understand him; it is because you won't understand him that he expresses himself so poorly."
> <cite>-- Elie Wiesel, foreword to "Night"(1960)</cite>

The term was later appropriated in incel forums to refer to sexually active "alpha males". Within the manosphere, Chads are viewed as constituting the top decile in terms of genetic fitness. In online animation drawings in the manosphere, a Chad is further tagged with the last name Thundercock and is often depicted as muscular with a very pronounced crotch bulge.
