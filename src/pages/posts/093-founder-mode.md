Latest blog post by YC founder Paul Graham is a good one

Following up on a
recent Brian Chesky's talk he challenges the idea that start-ups should be
handed over professional managers when they reach a certain stage of maturity

> The theme of Brian's talk was that the conventional wisdom about how to run
> larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, > well-meaning people advised
> him that he had to run the company in a certain way for it to scale. Their
> advice could be optimistically summarized as "hire good people and give them
> room to do their jobs." He followed this advice and the results were
> disastrous.

In conclusion, Graham advocates for a reevaluation of how leadership in growing companies is perceived, suggesting that the strong, hands-on leadership of founders should be more widely accepted and valued, rather than defaulting to professional managers who may not align with the company's original vision.

### Professional managers can be harmful

Graham is particularly critical of professional managers, labeling them as "professional fakers" and "skillful liars" who can drive companies into the ground. He believes that the core problem is that these managers often lack the deep connection to the company's mission that founders have.

### Founder Mode

To counter this, Graham proposes the concept of "founder mode," where founders stay deeply involved in the company's operations, interacting directly with key personnel regardless of their position in the hierarchy. He mentions practices like "skip-level" meetings, where founders bypass layers of management to speak directly with important team members. Graham references Steve Jobs as a successful example of a founder who maintained direct control and connection with his company, citing Jobs' annual retreats with Apple's 100 most important peopleâ€”who weren't necessarily the highest-ranking.

### conclusion

Aside from Steve Jobs, I can think of Basecamp's
[DHH](https://world.hey.com/dhh) and Elon Musk who chose to remain responsible
of their company's vision.
