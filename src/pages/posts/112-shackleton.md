My favorite read of 2025. Between mid-September and mid-October I devoured the 400 pages of this remarkable account, mostly during a few cool October days outside a cabin on the St. Lawrence River while watching freighters pass.

### Alfred Lansing, Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage

In 1914, an expedition led by Sir Ernest Shackleton set out for Antarctica with twenty-six crew members, sixty-nine dogs, and a cat. Their plan was to cross the continent by dog sled. Fate had other plans: the ship became trapped in the ice and the crew spent nearly two years before they returned to civilization.

This book came highly recommended by New York artist Tom Sachs, who summed it up like this:

> This is the adventure story by which all other adventure stories are judged. The worst thing that happened was a man losing his feet, but that was only because he didn't have the right shoes.

People read this book again and again because it pulls you out of daily life and drops you into a simple world of ice, sea, and survival.

Immersing yourself in the story makes you feel almost like a crew member. I quickly felt the vertigo of a small human community that can only rely on itself. There is no higher authority beyond the leader, Sir Shackleton, and nature itself.

This is a particularly rich read for those in positions of authority or
leadership. For these stranded people, navigation — and equally decision-making, observing the
elements (temperature, wind, seasons, currents), and handling conflicts —
becomes practical wisdom. You first establish your position, take reliable
measurements, then decide with the external factors in mind.

The story also works as a social metaphor: a small group makes critical choices that affect everyone's life. The idea of a minority making weighty decisions can feel uncomfortable. In Shackleton's case, though, you see a leader who acts with humanity and restraint: conflicts happen, but they are managed pragmatically and often admirably.

#### Who will like this book

- Anyone traveling along a large river or the sea.
- People who need to show leadership to get projects done. That is, anyone who runs large projects and must mobilize teams.
- Entrepreneurs, technical leaders, artists, and even teachers will get value from this book.

I recommend this book to anyone interested in resilience, leadership, and team spirit.
