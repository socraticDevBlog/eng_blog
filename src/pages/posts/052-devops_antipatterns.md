Main protagonist of William Gibson's novel _Neuromancer_, Case hits rock bottom in a lawless urban area 
in futuristic Japan. He learns someone wants to kill him for unpaid debts and all hell breaks loose.
After getting high on a stimulant named "Dex", Case acquires a baton and rents a pistol and bullets to
defend himself.

In chapter 1 of _Neuromancer_, we are introduced to a nervous cyberspace cowboy who has nothing to loose.
It's unclear if this main character is looking to get rid of Wage, the man who allegedly wants to kill him, or
if he's just randomly trying to escape someone covertly following him thru this dangerous neighborhood.

Chapter 1 begins and ends at a comfortable bar called "Chat". After a crazy escape from an industrial/office building,
Case finally gets to confront Wage at the bar. Under the protection of the bartender holding a riot gun to Wage's
face, Case and Wage settles their dispute.

Chapter 1 really ends at Case's temporary home: the _Cheap hotel_. There he rents a coffin-sized room on a weekly basis.
Noticing the lock had been tempered with, thinking it is most likely a sign of his ex-girlfriend Linda's visit, he
nevertheless gets back into his cell. He is welcomed by the "pepperbox muzzle of a flechette pistol". He meets Molly, a hired 
bodyguard tasked to bring back Case to her Employer. He wont argue with this surgically improved woman who has grey mirrors for eyes and whose
nails are ten retractable scalpel knives.
