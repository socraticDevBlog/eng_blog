### setup - CVE-2024-3094 is a supply-chain attack

Supply-chain hacks like
[Solarwinds](https://www.wired.com/story/the-untold-story-of-solarwinds-the-boldest-supply-chain-hack-ever/)
and now [xz](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094). From my naive
perspective of a hands-on devops engineer, this sort of attacks mesmerize me:
they seem so big, clever, and unexpected. At the end of the day, it seems like
regular tech people like me are pretty much helpless against them.

> In a supply chain attack, hackers exploit vulnerabilities in a trusted supplier or partner to infiltrate a target's systems. Rather than attacking the target directly, they compromise the supplier's software, hardware, or services to gain unauthorized access. This allows them to bypass the target's defenses and potentially steal sensitive information or disrupt operations.

### question 1: how would you grade the severity of `xz exploit` (CVE-2024-3094)? are we playing chicken little and exagerrating its importance or is it really a big deal for the security of our computer systems?

### question 2: I'm a big fan of "shifting left" on security during the Software Development Lifecyle. For example, at the organization I work for, developers are explicitely taught basic principles of secure programming. On top of adopting programming best practices, devops and dev tooling teams are integrating security into the software delivery pipeline with automated security scans and scheduled patching, is it even possible for software engineer to protect their systems against supply-chain attacks?

### question 3: We've learned that the `xz exploit` was discovered by sheer luck by a researcher. This leads me to believe there could be many more zero-day exploits in the wild. Do you share this sentiment? If yes, what can we do to protect our organizations? Can we expect our corporate compliance and security teams to tackle this minefield or should we rely on the industry big players like Microsoft, Google, and Redhat to protect us?
