### John Carreyrou(2018), "Bad Blood", Knopf

⚠️ _This section mentions death by suicide. If you or someone you know is having
a hard time: insist on asking for help to pass through this hardship_ [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)

> In late 2015, Carreyrou began a series of investigative articles on Theranos, published in The Wall Street Journal on the blood-testing startup founded by Elizabeth Holmes. The articles questioned the company's claim to be able to run a wide range of lab tests from a tiny sample of blood from a finger prick.

Carreyrou's Wall Street Journal articles were instrumental to blowing the
whistle over Theranos scam and led to its fall.

Beyond what the public already knows about the Theranos debacle, I took home a
few learnings that consolidate my opinion about the evil side of human nature.
Especially since lying and "faking it" have become _de rigueur_ for those who
care about reaching poorly reflected on goals. Stretching the truth, making
excuses, and making use of fallacies such as as [appeals to
pity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Appeal_to_pity) are daily faults to most of
humanity. Innofensive crimes most of the time. Most of the time we simply stop
trusting such characters. But when such characters are charismatic enough to
fool the powerful people of the world, they gather an almost invincible
strenght. And that's what happened in Theranos. Elizabeth Holmes and her lover,
Ramesh Balwani, rose to power by money and blind trust shoveled their way from
four-star american general James Mattis and other major figures. And with money
they were able to silence their employees with systematic use of intimidation
by infamous lawyer David Boies. That David Boies who is known to leverage
private investigators, including ex-Mossad agents, to track and intimidate
victims and journalists.

> failure.

What marked me in this sotry was he untimely death, by suicide, of a Theranos employee Mental health being just as important as physical health, such
events are a cold reminder that we are not our job. Despite the constant demand
to be a team player and to bend over backward, I would offer but one advice:
play the role for which you're paid for, but preserve your autonomy at all
cost. Concretely: keep at least a year salary in your bank account, live below
your means, and invest in yourself.
