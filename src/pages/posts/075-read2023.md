### qntm(2018), "There is no Antimemetics Division"

This "sci-fi" novel is the best story I've read in 2023. I quoted _sci-fi_
because it is not your regular science-fiction novel. It is nothing you've read
before: a mix between philosophy, journalism, and science-fiction. You'll read
the narrative of a researcher who works at a mysterious institution, the
_Antimemetics Division_ where the subject-matter is memory and how it can be weaponized.

> "An antimeme is an idea with self-censoring properties; an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it.
><br><br>
>Antimemes are real. Think of any piece of information which you wouldn't share with anybody, like passwords, taboos and dirty secrets. Or any piece of information which would be difficult to share even if you tried: complex equations, very boring passages of text, large blocks of random numbers, and dreams...
><br><br>
>But anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain something you can't record or remember? How do you fight a war against an enemy with effortless, perfect camouflage, when you can never even know that you're at war?
><br><br>
>Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.
><br><br>
> No, this is not your first day."

### John Carreyrou(2018), "Bad Blood", Knopf

> In late 2015, Carreyrou began a series of investigative articles on Theranos, published in The Wall Street Journal on the blood-testing startup founded by Elizabeth Holmes. The articles questioned the company's claim to be able to run a wide range of lab tests from a tiny sample of blood from a finger prick.

Carreyrou's Wall Street Journal articles were instrumental to blowing the
whistle over Theranos scam and led to its fall.

Beyond what the public already knows about the Theranos debacle, I took home a
few learnings that consolidate my opinion about the evil side of human nature.
Especially since lying and "faking it" have become _de rigueur_ for those who
care about reaching poorly reflected on goals. Stretching the truth, making
excuses, and making use of fallacies such as as [appeals to
pity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Appeal_to_pity) are daily faults to most of
humanity. Innofensive crimes most of the time. Most of the time we simply stop
trusting such characters. But when such characters are charismatic enough to
fool the powerful people of the world, they gather an almost invincible
strenght. And that's what happened in Theranos. Elizabeth Holmes and her lover,
Ramesh Balwani, rose to power by money and blind trust shoveled their way from
four-star american general James Mattis and other major figures. And with money
they were able to silence their employees with systematic use of intimidation
by infamous lawyer David Boies. That David Boies who is known to leverage
private investigators, including ex-Mossad agents, to track and intimidate
victims and journalists.

> Ian Gibbons (1946-2013) was a british biochemist who served as Chief
> scientist of Theranos. In 2013, Gibbons intentionally overdosed on
> acetaminophen the night before he was scheduled to be deposed in a lawsuit
> related to Theranos. He was hospitalized for several days and died from liver
> failure.

What marked me in this sotry was he untimely death, by suicide, of a Theranos employee Mental health being just as important as physical health, such
events are a cold reminder that we are not our job. Despite the constant demand
to be a team player and to bend over backward to employer, I would offer but one advice:
play the role for which you're paid for, but preserve your autonomy at all
cost. Concretely: keep at least a year salary in your bank account, live below
your means, and invest in yourself.

### Donella H. Meadows(2008), "Thinking in Systems"

Another book that challenges deeply rooted misconceptions and proposes a new
paradigm to reflect about systems. Getting introduced to systems analysis will improve your professional success and the value you provide your customers.

> [Systems analysis](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Systems_analysis) is "the process of studying a procedure or business to identify its goal and purposes and create systems and procedures that will efficiently achieve them"

### Gene Kim(2014), "The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win"

A cute novel about a newly minted manager learning how to improve process at
his workplace.

This book was recommended by my team's dev manager. I had started reading it
but stopped because I experienced cringe from it... Came back to it a few
months later and glad I did. Beyond the cringe, I've learned it exposed this manager's
profesionnal philosophy. A philosophy based on LEAN and understanding the
importance of flow; even in a software engineering context.

While the manufacturing metaphor doesn't perfectly fits software
engineering, I'm sure software engineers' happiness will improve if their managers adopt some sort
of LEAN mindset. Otherwise, competent engineers will get slowed down by lack of
a sound process or assigned to soul-sucking duties by un-enlightened managers who reward firefighters and yes-persons.

### Neil Strauss, "Everyone Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness"


### Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe, "When McKinsey Comes to Town"

### Jonathan Ames, "What's not to love?"

### Mark Twain, "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"

### Maurice Maeterlinck, "Les Aveugles"

### Skelton and Pais, "Team Topologies"

### J.D. Salinger, "Nine Stories"

### Bruce Schneier(2024), "A Hacker's Mind"

This book isn't bad, but I would not recommend it. 

In a nutshell, the author insists on not talking about computer hacking, but
about non-technical frauds and law-bending events that, by some stretch, are
hacking too.

There are so many great books waiting to be read, this is not one of them.
