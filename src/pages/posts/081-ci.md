Why are _Operational Developers_ such a hot commodities in the
industry?

A bit like the catcher in a baseball game, they have the best vision of
the playing field. 

Most DevOps engineers are either former developers who
learned how software gets deployed and managed in production or
Operations/SysAdmins people who learned how software gets built. They have a solid
understanding of the software lifecycle (SDLC) while knowing how to provision,
configure, and monitor infrastructure.

### are they hot commodities because they possess essential tech skills?

Yes and no

DevOps engineers either make or break their organization by the way they handle
complexity. 

In tech, complexity is inescapable. Successful DevOps engineers have developed
a mindset and a toolset to handle complexity. 

From an horizontal axis, if you
may, an experienced DevOps engineer understands the SDLC from user stories to
services actually running on servers. 

From a vertical axis, they understand the
systems they work on from an high-level perspeective to their concrete
implementation. When something goes wrong or an improvement is required, they
know where to look and how to debug and validate their changes.

### DevOps customers are the business

Our customers are the business. How do we provide value to the business?

- by providing an effective and reliable automation of the software delivery pipeline
- by producing industry-standard metrics that measures the software delivery lifecycle
- by accelerating the delivery of value to the customer
- by reducing operation costs

### how to get the most out of your DevOps engineers?

Talented engineers are usually self-driven people. They don't need much to be
happy and deliver tremendous value to your business:

Trust them to do the right thing 

Always use evidence and facts to get your point across

Let them work on the problems they choose

Don't interfere, unless you have to
