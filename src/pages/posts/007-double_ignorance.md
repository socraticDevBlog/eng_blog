Double ignorance refers to the cognitive state of an individual who is so ignorant that he ignores his own ignorance.

Men love to express their opinion about all matters without taking time to learn and reflect. Having an opinion about everything is recomforting and soothes our anguish. It puts us under the impression we understand the world in which we live. And it is also a way to impose ourselves unto others ; to dominate.

Plato’s _Allegory of the Cave_ contains many forms of symbolism used to instruct the reader in the nature of perception. The cave represents superficial physical reality. It also represents ignorance, as those in the cave live accepting what they see at face value. The freed prisoner represents those who understand that the physical world is only a shadow of the truth.
