> it requires a lot of thought to stay on top of what actions will produce the best value

I was bantering online about Pareto principle and how intentional a technology
professional ought to be about this legendary 20% of effort.

A toughtful tech executive replied to my banter: "it requires a lot of thought to stay on top
of what actions will produce the best value".

First and foremost I agree that no "careful analysis and planning" could pin
point what crucial effort (the 20%) would yield 80% of the value.

### heuristics and principles

Long-winded planning and careful analysis in technology don't guarantee success.

However, a technology professional can rely on heuristics to guide his activities;
to provide the best value for his clients and avoid spending energy on
low-value work.

#### reducing work-in-progress

Work-in-progress (wip) is the measure of partially completed work items. In
software and IT, we notice _wip_ piling up when a developer starts a new task
while waiting for a pull request approval, a meeting with a product manager, or
for security access being granted to proceed with current task. Usually, every new task
entails its set of blockers therefore the wip can accumulate at an exponential
rate.

In that case, every effort to reduce work-in-progress in your daily routine
will accelerate value delivery.

Lean philosophy got this counter-intuitive motto: "Stop starting and start
finishing". For a dev, it means that they should raise their hand as soon as
their current task is blocked. They need to seek prompt assistance from
teammates instead of starting a new task while hoping the previous one gets
magically unblocked.

#### producing quality work

Producing quality work is essential. 

When a tech professional tackles an issue we want the issue to be put in
context and its details understood. For example,
during a transition as a consultant, I was told "We expect you to become the team
expert in this technology when current consultant leaves at the end of their
contract". It meant that knowing this technology was the principal way I would
provide value to my new client.

A similar mindset should guide a developer tackling a bug or developing a new
feature. They should become the "expert" of this bug or feature. They are able
to explain why the bug happened or why this feature is getting developed. They
are able to explain in details how they intend to fix the issue or produce a working
feature. Finally, they should have minimally tested out their contribution to
make sure it works as intended.

Producing quality work usually takes more time but it is well worth it:

- fixing a defect gets more expensive at every step of the software lifecycle;
- increases value delivery since building on top of low quality works is hard;
- delivering quality just makes you more credible as a technology
  professionnal; people will love working with you.

take pride in your work!

#### do not reinvent the wheel

"Am I the first person to be having this problem to solve?"

Before starting digging too hard to solve a problem, ask yourself the above
question. Most likely, other people had had this problem before you and there
are commonly accepted solutions to it.

Work smarter, not harder

Take the time to search online or talk to colleagues to
figure out how others professionnals might have solved a similar problem in
their organization.

#### be transparent, ask for feedback on your work

Seventeenth century, French philosopher René Descartes famously recommended to always walk in a
straight line if you get lost in the forest.

This advice might only be valid to small european forests... 

Nowadays, we are more connected than ever. There is no shortage of people who will be delighted to
criticize your work. Take advantage of it!

I think the worse mistake to do is keeping to yourself to avoid criticism.
Worse than that is actively discouraging peers to give you the time of the day.
You might not even realize you are doing it, but these are sure ways to make
others stop helping you improve thru advices and criticism:

- giving excuses to justify faulty work (_ad misericordiam_ fallacy);
- attacking the other party directly or indirectly (_tu quoque_ fallacy).

Better do this instead:

- put forward your work and actively ask for feedback;
- accept advices, follow up with the person and show them the improved work;
- separate your self-worth from the work you produce; it is the work produced
  that is getting criticized not yourself.

The days when a lone programmer could build a valuable problem from A to Z are
long gone. You work with intelligent and competent people. You'd be a fool not
to take advantage of this situation. Take the wager to accept criticism because
it will help your organization build better products and it will help you
improve your skills.

### conclusion

I usually don't write conclusions to my blog posts. 

I'll write one for those who haven't figure out yet what I was blagging about here.

The conclusion is that a successful technology professionnal can safely rest on
Pareto principle. Although it is near impossible to plan ahead of time what
actions (the 20%) will create the most value, there are sound principles and
heuristics one should adopt to work smarter, not harder.
