Daring to reflect and question our conception of humanity will be the most productive form of resistance to artificial intelligence, more so than refusing to use AI at work.

The commercialization and commodification of Large Language Models (LLMs) is underway. AI is entering our daily lives in the form of specialized assistants. Many programmers like myself have been using ChatGPT and Claude.ai for several months to increase their velocity. We ask them questions to diagnose errors, validate game plans, or generate code snippets instead of spending time writing code without added value.

### Resistance is Futile

Artificial intelligence is more than just a buzzword in 2024. Business leaders and the financial market are on board or want to get on board. Resistance has become almost futile. Even if we refuse to integrate this new technology as individuals, its impact on our lives will still occur. Whether it's the search results proposed by our Google searches or the bank's response to a mortgage or life insurance application.

Most professions will see artificial intelligence integrated into their daily tasks in the form of electronic assistants. The first impact will probably not be to make you lose your livelihood but rather to make you exponentially more efficient. In short, before losing your job, you will simply prevent the hiring of other people with the same skills as yours...

What if you refuse on principle to submit to this exercise? You will be replaced by another person with skills similar to yours but with fewer scruples.

### More Than Survival Mode

It's philosophy that will save you. This millennial discipline that considers itself the search for wisdom.

By using our rationality, we have created a leviathan that now makes us tremble with the probability that it could replace us; make us useless.

Just as the invention of the telescope and microscope questioned many things, the invention of AI has created an opportunity to question our place in the world as human beings.

Does my value as a person stem solely from the tasks I can accomplish for an employer?

Now that a tool can produce convincing answers to most questions in a matter of
milliseconds, how can I now compete against others in my efforts to always have
the final word on all topics?

More than survival mode, we must embrace the advent of artificial intelligence as an opportunity to tackle the question of determining what a human being is. What essentially distinguishes us from the machine?

Daring to reflect and question our conception of humanity will be the most
productive form of resistance to artificial intelligence; much more than
refusing to use AI at work.
