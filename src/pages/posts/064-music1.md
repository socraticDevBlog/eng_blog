Most developers believe that listening to music while working
helps to reach a flow state. Listening to music while working
helps to raise their level of concentration.

Looking back, we can see that the benefits of music on
human development were already known at least since Greek antiquity. As much
education of young Athenians than that of young Spartans was based on
two disciplines: gymnastics and music. Gymnastics as an activity
preparing young people for military rigors. But also as an activity
excellent in itself. The combative (agonal) character of the ancient Greeks
was expressed in particular during the Olympic Games where the triumph assured the
winners to be honored by their peers throughout their lives.

Music, on the other hand, was considered the supreme art, "occupying a
essential place in the political, social and religious life of Greece
Ancient". By its intangible (non-material) nature, music represents the
gateway to the realm of the ideas: from mathematics to Philosophy.
In addition, the learning and practice of measurement and the science of
proportions also have an ethical aspect.

## resistance music

_Rembetika_ is the music most often associated with Greece. The sound of
bouzouki, oriental tones and chants similar to a litany.

It's not so much a musical style as a subculture in its own right. The culture of
working class and oppressed by the Ottoman occupiers. The _rembetika_ is a
artistic way of resisting the invader. A way to remember yourself.
Affirm their identity.

It is also said that the _rembetika_ is the 'Greek blues'. We understand the _blues_
like a state of mind, like a visceral feeling. A way of expressing emotions
complex as the lost origin and uprooting. A state of mind hope and
the despair.

## occultism and avant-garde

The singer Genesis P-Orridge conveys social criticism through his music
radical. A critique of capitalist society and all that can be
considered an intellectual opium. As much by their personality, their sexual
identity than through their music, Genesis P-Orridge fully assumes their role
as an artist. Someone who challenges conventional wisdom and offers a
new view of the world.

> "Strangely, those who are most despised today are the best
> cut out for survival" - Genesis P-Orridge

P-Orridge died at the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 14th, 2020) in New York
City, they (preferred pronoun) will not have the opportunity to be able to say "I was
right!" Indeed, P-Orridge had long predicted the end of mankind thru a deadly pandemic...

Listening to the music of Genesis P-Orridge is not a pleasant experience. A bit
like it would be to be a contestant participating in a session of 'fight club'
is not pleasant. That is to say, we would kind of be forcing ourselves to listen to it to obtain
certain benefits which can only be obtained by ceasing to wallow in our comfort zone.

We must listen to the music of Genesis P-Orridge, _COUM Transmissions_ and
_Throbbing Gristle_ on purpose. As in all avant-garde art, there is a search
artistic pre-production. To appreciate this music, intellectual efforts are
required. One is rewarded for having researched the history of
the artist, their philosophy and their message. It helps us overcome
discomfort and take advantage of the artist's message.

## healing through music

The music of the Moroccan village of Jahejouka was popularized in the West
in the 1960s by Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones and Timothy Leary, the
spokesperson for psychedelic culture.

Jajouka's master musicians are inspired by Sufism. Sufism is a
mystical stream of Islam. Sufism is organized into brotherhoods and it
nurtures a mystical approach to spirituality. Their music has the effect of
inducing a state of trance among his listeners.

Their musical practice aims for ecstasy: union with the divine.

> We have a ceremony every year for Boujeloud (A half-man, half-goat deity
> representing fertility). And then we play the music every Friday to honor
> this saint, Sidi Ahmed Sheikh, and for sick and crazy people who have lost
> their minds. And after we play, the people become normal in their lives.
> We've been doing it for thousands of years. It's like a hospital. Many people
> who come have gone to doctors in Europe and not been cured. Then they stay in
> the village and we tie them up and we play the music every week, and the feel
> better.
