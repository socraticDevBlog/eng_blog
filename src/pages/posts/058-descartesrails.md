The world of software development celebrates innovators. Those who
challenge preconceptions and venture into uncharted waters.

But the development world also supports conformists and
sloths.

Many dogmas are also erected to comfort the developers
ways to persist the status quo:

- a good programmer is a lazy programmer
- don't reinvent the wheel

But we wouldn't have the opportunity to have our lives made easier by these tools without the risks and
the strokes of genius of innovators who bet on starting from scratch.

## René Descartes and the Method

René Descartes (1592-1650) is considered the father of modern philosophy. After studying in a respected Jesuit college, he broke away from the
tradition and old books to contribute to the progress of sciences such as
optics and geometry. He refused to submit to the
principle of authority and rejected blind respect for philosophical tradition.

He published the _Discourse on the Method_, written in french, in 1637. At that time, the language of
scholars was Latin. French was the language of the uneducated people.

Why write to be read by ordinary people?

Descartes maintained that every human had enough common sense to
discover the truth for themselves. As long a sound method to
to direct ones mind is followed, progress in knowledge is assured.

By writing this little treatise in popular language, Descartes demonstrates his
confidence in his method of directing his mind to true knowledge.

To discover the truth, he invites the reader to doubt everything. Not to take
any opinion for certain unless one has examined it closely.

The method begins with a methodical doubt. Absolute skepticism. But temporary skepticism.

If nothing is certain, not even what I see or what I can touch, on
what fundamental certainty can I establish on my journey towards
knowledge ?

I think. The evidence that a mind is thinking and doubting is the most certain
thing in the world.

Thus Descartes inaugurated modern philosophy. A way of thinking no longer centered
on the things of the world, but on the mind that thinks and knows. Sure,
it's interesting to know biology, for example. But no science is more important
than knowing the thinking mind.

Our mind is the fundamental unit of everything
our knowledge.

## David Heinemeier Hansson and Ruby on rails

David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) is a well-known figure among web developers. He
is the creator of the famous framework [Ruby on rails](https://rubyonrails.org).

> Ruby on Rails, also called RoR or Rails, is a free web framework written in Ruby. It follows the model-view-controller design pattern. It offers a structure that allows you to develop quickly and intuitively.
> <p><cite>Wikipedia, "Ruby on rails"</cite><p>

A bit like for Descartes, the development of a credible web framework was
felt as a necessity for _DHH_. As a web developer, his goal
was building web applications faster and easier. His experience with
existing technologies were still just as frustrating to him.

The guiding idea behind _Ruby on rails_ was to foster a positive experience to the developers building their web application. He relied on
his developer experience to release a polished framework that could be
understood and appreciated by all developers.

### sole master on board

> [...] I took it into my head to consider that often there is not so much perfection
> in works composed of several parts, and made by hand from various
> masters, than in those for whom only one has worked.
> <p><cite>Descartes, "Discourse on Method", second part</cite></p>

At the beginning of the adventure, _DHH_ did not authorize any other
contributor to make commits to the project. According to him, we must leave the
vision of the project get established before letting other programmers
contribute. The risk
to ruin a codebase by too hasty collaboration is too big.

## conclusion

I do not believe that one can dismiss out of hand the accusation of
"reinventing the wheel". It is better to use existing tools than building ours
from scratch. In the majority of circumstances,
other developers have experienced challenges similar to ours. Solutions
often more effective and elegant than our attempts are readily available online. Most programming languages ​​have built-in tools for
perform typical operations.

Descartes and David Heinemeier first experienced the absence of a satisfactorysolution as
primary drivers of their projects. They have this in common that no solution
existed to fulfill their visions.

Moreover, by creating a new system of thought or a new framework of
web development, vision is paramount.

We can afford to reinvent the wheel if our vision promises considerable
progress compared to the _status quo_.
