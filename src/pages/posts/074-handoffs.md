Building, delivering, and maintaining software systems is a process aimed at
delivering value to someone. This someone is called the customer and
the people involved in the process, stakeholders. It is a process
requiring different expertises and usually cannot be fullfilled by a single
person or a single team. The complexity of the process, the fact that this
process has many moving parts, leads to common issues such as misunderstandings,
delays, and bottlenecks. For example, a misunderstanding can be developers building
a feature that doesn't solve a customer's problem; delays are a mismatch
between deadlines (due dates) and the actual state of the software system;
bottlenecks are areas where the flow of work slows down or stops.

_Flow of work_ is an ideal goal to which every organizations and every teams in
these organizations should aim at:

### Dependencies and Hand-offs

Dependencies and Handoffs are the usual suspect when teams have to deal with
too much _work in progress_ (WIP).

Dependencies become visible when work items stop flowing down the value chain
because they either require another team's intervention or because the hand-off
process cannot be completed.

Hand-offs are a specifc kind of dependencies that occur within a team or
between two closely collaborating teams. Hand-offs occur when a work item gets
worked on and handed-off to the next person in the chain for them to work on them according
to their specific expertise and skills. For example, a product manager
hands-off a user story to the team's designer for them to design how this feature
gets included into the product. Once designer's work is done, they hand it over
to developers. Once the feature is implemented, developers hand-off the feature
to their testing specialist.

#### why are Dependencies and Hand-offs to be avoided?

In order to improve value delivery's flow, dependencies and hand-offs must be
carefully analyzed and addressed because they are slowing down value delivery.

- every hand-offs slows down the flow
- for every work item, there is non-explicit and non-documented knowledge required to understand it.
  This tacit knowledge tends to get lost or diluted at every hand-off

#### ways to reduce negative effects of hand-offs

1. limit the number of hand-offs in the flow of a work item
2. improve communication structures between team members and adjacent
   collaborating teams' members
3. increase team autonomy, experiment with cross-collaboration on the same work
   item, etc.

### conclusion

Dependencies and hand-offs are intrinsic side-effects of work in software
and system engineering. They are not intrinsically bad. But they should get
minimized in order to improve the flow of value delivery.

Being able to identify these bottlenecks is a step in the right direction. It
means you are already able to visualize the _work in progress_ (WIP) and have a
feel about the nature of the bottlenecks that are slowing down your value stream.

Next step in your continuous improvement journey will be about improving _feedback loops_.
Asking yourself "Am I building the right thing?" and "How satisfied are my
customers with my product?".

Knowing that you are building the right thing is as important as building it
right or building it fast!
