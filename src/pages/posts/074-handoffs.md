Building, delivering, and maintaining software systems is a process aimed at
delivering value to someone. This someone is called the customer and
the people involved in the process, stakeholders. It is a process
requiring different expertises and usually cannot be fullfilled by a single
person or a single team. The complexity of the process, the fact that this
process has many moving parts, leads to common issues such as misunderstanings,
delays, bottlenecks. For example, a misunderstanding can be developers building
a feature that doesn't solve a customer's problem; delays are a mismatch
between deadlines (due dates) and actual state of the software or system;
bottlenecks are areas where the flow of work is slowed or stopped.

Flow of work is an ideal goal by which every organization and every teams in
this organization should want to achieve:

> "Flow occurs when there is a smooth, linear, and fast movement of work product from step to step in a relevant value stream"

### Dependencies and Hand-offs

Dependencies and Handoffs are the usual suspects when teams have to deal with
too many blockers in their work in progress.

Dependencies become visible when work items get blocked because the require
interventions from another team. Or require that another work to be completed.

Hand-offs are a specifc kind of dependencies that occur within a team or
between two closely collaborating teams. Hand-offs occur when a work item gets
worked on and handed-off to the next person for them to work on them according
to their specific expertise and skills. For example, a product manager
hands-off a user story to team's designer for them to design how this feature
gets included into the product. Once designer's work is done, they hand it over
to developers. Once the feature is implemented into the software,
developers hand-off the feature to their testing specialist.

#### why are Dependencies and Hand-offs to be avoided?

In order to improve value delivery's flow, dependencies and hand-offs must
carefully be analyzed and addressed because they are slowing down value delivery.

- every hand-offs slows down the flow
- for every work item, there is non-explicit and non-documented knowledge required to understand it.
  This tacit knowledge tends to get lost or diluted at every hand-off

#### ways to reduce negative effects of hand-offs

1. limit the number of hand-offs in the flow of a work item
2. improve communication structures between team members and adjacent
   collaborating teams' members
3. increase team autonomy, experiment with cross-collaboration on the same work
   item, etc

### conclusion

Dependencies and hand-offs are intrinsic side-effects of our work in software
and system engineering. They are not bad in themselves. But they should get
minimized in order to improve the flow of value delivery.

Being able to identify these bottlenecks is a step in the right direction. It
means you are able to visualize the work in progress and have a feel for what
bottlenecks are slowing down your value stream.

Next step in your continuous improvement will be improving feedback loops.
Asking yourself "Am I building the right thing?".  

Knowing that you are building the right thing is as important as building it
right or building it fast!
