## chapter 3 (part 2 - The shopping expedition)
By the end of chapter 3, Case would have connected to cyberspace, to the Matrix.

> Matrix: "Has its roots in primitive arcade games. Early graphic programs and military experimentation with cranial jacks."

> cyberspace: "A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts..."

##### the Finn
Molly and Case gets to integrate a new team member: the Finn. Unofficially, behind Armitage's back, they consult the Finn to scan their bodys. Have they gotten new implants they weren't aware off? Molly goes first and confirms a list of known implants. The Finn reveals, about Case: 

> "Guy's a virgin. Some cheap dental work, is all."

They also discuss Armitage's identity and goals. The Finn reveals that Armitage is just following orders. From whom? He doesn't know. But he knows the orders are not coming from a government, the japanese mafia, or japanese big conglomerate (zaibatsu).

##### Molly
Molly brings Case over to Manhattan for a real breakfast. In fact her main objective is to visit the Finn.

Case notices that Molly is at home in _the Sprawl_. The Sprawl, also known as BAMA (Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis), is a urban area where the Matrix and data are flowing. Especially in a few blocks of Manhattan and a century old industrial area of Atlanta.

> "her Sprawl wasn't his [...] She'd led him through a dozen bars and clubs he'd never seen before, taking care of business, usually with no more than a nod. Maintaining connections."

##### Armitage

Case have a hard time remembering his trip back home from Japan. Only airports and some shopping trips with Molly: Narita, Schipol, Orly. He remembers a train trip with Molly to their final destination: 

> A large empty room. "Blank walls, no windows, a single white-painted steel door. The walls were coated with countless layers of white latex paint. Factory space."

Armitage adds precision about Case's mission. Specifically about his new pancreas and treatment of his impaired nervous system. 

Armitage explains that, during surgery, fifteen toxin sacs containing a mycotoxin have been "bonded to the lining of various main arteries". The sacs will slowly desintegrate and release a toxin similar to the one Case had been plagued with. Toxins that had destroyed his nervous system.

Only after the end of this mission would Armitage provide a remedy to this predicament.

Case is held hostage to this new dependency.
