(updated thursday 2022-05-09 by adding chapter 4 summary)

## chapter 3 (part 2 - The shopping expedition)
By the end of chapter 3, Case would have connected to cyberspace, to the Matrix.

> Matrix: "Has its roots in primitive arcade games. Early graphic programs and military experimentation with cranial jacks."

> cyberspace: "A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts..."

##### the Finn
Molly and Case gets to integrate a new team member: the Finn. Unofficially, behind Armitage's back, they consult the Finn to scan their bodys. Have they gotten new implants they weren't aware off? Molly goes first and confirms a list of known implants. The Finn reveals, about Case: 

> "Guy's a virgin. Some cheap dental work, is all."

They also discuss Armitage's identity and goals. The Finn reveals that Armitage is just following orders. From whom? He doesn't know. But he knows the orders are not coming from a government, the japanese mafia, or japanese big conglomerate (zaibatsu).

##### Molly
Molly brings Case over to Manhattan for a real breakfast. In fact her main objective is to visit the Finn.

Case notices that Molly is at home in _the Sprawl_. The Sprawl, also known as BAMA (Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis), is a urban area where the Matrix and data are flowing. Especially in a few blocks of Manhattan and a century old industrial area of Atlanta.

> "her Sprawl wasn't his [...] She'd led him through a dozen bars and clubs he'd never seen before, taking care of business, usually with no more than a nod. Maintaining connections."

##### Armitage

Case have a hard time remembering his trip back home from Japan. Only airports and some shopping trips with Molly: Narita, Schipol, Orly. He remembers a train trip with Molly to their final destination: 

> A large empty room. "Blank walls, no windows, a single white-painted steel door. The walls were coated with countless layers of white latex paint. Factory space."

Armitage adds precision about Case's mission. Specifically about his new pancreas and treatment of his impaired nervous system. 

Armitage explains that, during surgery, fifteen toxin sacs containing a mycotoxin have been "bonded to the lining of various main arteries". The sacs will slowly desintegrate and release a toxin similar to the one Case had been plagued with. Toxins that had destroyed his nervous system.

Only after the end of this mission would Armitage provide a remedy to this predicament.

Case is held hostage to this new dependency.

## chapter 4 - the heist

In chapter 4, the duo Case and Molly enters into action by setting up and executing a heist in Sense/net building. Case immersed himself in the Matrix for a good 9 days, but the action is considerably shortened into a tight chapter. Armitage mission was getting hold of Dixie Flatline: a 'construct' stored into the library of Sense/net building. 

> A construct is "A ROM recording of a personality which allows for a reconstruction of that person."

Case remained in the loft hooked to his Sendai and SimStim. A SimStim is a way to embody another person; to feel his sensations. Case embodied Molly who moved thru the Sprawl to prepare and execute the heist. He can feel what she feels, sees what she sees. But cannot communicate with her; tell her what to do.

For 9 days, he stayed in the cyberspace or into Molly's skin.

At an electronic marketplace, Molly met with Larry. A shady personage who put her in touch with the _Panther Moderns_. 

> The _Moderns_ are "a global group of teenage hackers and pranksters, who can be purchased by outside groups." 
 
They will assist Molly creating chaos at the Sense/net building in order to steal the construct of Dixie Flatline. A notable trait of the _Moderns_ is their camouflage suits; they can blend with the surrounding like chameleons!

Molly got badly hurt during the heist. To escape the building, she had to numb her pain with endorphines. Then she went under surgery.

Back to the loft, Armitage received the construct from Yonderboy (the leader of the Panther Moderns) against a thick stack of money as payment.

Younderboy tells Armitage why he wouldn't count the money:

>"You'll pay. You're a Mr. Who. You pay to stay one. Not a Mr. Name."

Despite this, Yonderboy delivers a message to Case. A name.

Wintermute.
