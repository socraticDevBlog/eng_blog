About a month ago, Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino, two highly influencial
behavioral psychologists were accused of fabricating data to support their
trademark hypotheses. Ironical as it may be, these two academia con artists
were self-proclaimed expert in _dishonesty_. What are they accused of?
Systematicaly fabricating or altering research data to make sure they support
their beliefs and hypotheses.

I am neither competent in the field of behavioral psychology nor I am an expert
in regard of data analytics. Even though I believe that irrationality is an
important driver of human behaviors, this case interests from a moral and
philosophical perspective: why and when does it become a moral duty to denounce lies and
toxic behaviors?

Let's start with some axioms about human nature; some opinions to which we are gonna take as true:

- humans lie and are quite good at it;
- humans will pretty much do anything (including lying) to fullfill their needs;
- when confronted on their lies and bad actions, humans will pretty much do
  anything to protect their status including lie and counter attack.

Humans are dirty motherfuckers! how about that for an axiom?

### the power of storytelling

As technologist, don't we get properly aroused by "ideas backed by data"? Will
adding some numbers or a diagram on a Powerpoint slide increase our chances to
gain support for our next project?

Using numbers to support a claim is better than a raw claim. But a carefully
crafted story that illustrates our proposal is even better. I'm being half
cynical here but crafting a great story is worth your time if you care about
getting what you want from others. Notice how hard it is to push back against a
proposal when the person supporting is using a well-crafted story to invite
sympathy. It could be true that they worked on the proposal late at night and
on week-ends, but no matter how hard they work on it: it doesn't mean their
proposal is sound! (Building the next social media platform? I don't think so!)

In my opinion, Ariely and Gino thrived for long because of their expertise in
storytelling. Moreover, I sense that Ariely will survive this crisis thanks to
his intense creativity and amicable demeanor while Gino's career is more likely
over for a lack in charisma. In another sense, Ariely is a creative thinker who
burned himself trying to play the scientist while Gino burned herself for
simply being a bad scientist.

### risks and duty

Why would we tolerate being abused and lied to? Why would some person perform
deception in the first place? It would be about incentives, according to the
media coverage of the Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino's scandal. These two
high-profile academics would earn a comfortable income from their university
tenure and private conferences (Gino would charge from 50 000 to 100 000 per
private event). The insights they peddled suited the corporate mindset like a
glove. Gino's last articles were about "managing a polarized workforce",
"unconscious bias training" and "cracking the code of sustained collaboration".
They would sell their snake oil like hot cakes to insurance companies or
governments in crisis. So why not doctor those pesky Excel sheets if it can buy
you another book deal, a first-class trip around the world, or a
_pied-à-terre_ in Manhattan?

People around these two rascals were not blind to the con. Although Ariely
semmed to have been appreciated by everyone who had interacted with him, Gino's
social scoreboard was equivocal. Some students have proved critical toward her:
for her belittling attitude and criticising her research methods. One french
graduate student, Zoé Ziani, overtly doubed Gino' science. But she was shunned
by her professors:

> When she expressed her doubts, the adviser snapped at her, “Don’t ever say
> that!” [...] In an e-mail, the adviser wrote, “Academic research is like a
> conversation at a cocktail party. You are storming in, shouting ‘You suck!’ ”
>
> <cite>Gideon Lewis-Kraus (2023), "The New Yorker"</cite>

Academia is a strange ecosystem indeed. Professors enjoy the safety of their tenure
and have little incentive to be overtly critical of their colleagues.

Unless martyrdom sounds seducing to you, I would not recommend becoming a
single whistleblower. Single whistle blowers are either unsuccessful or, if they are, they are
subject to reprisals that can range from counter attacks(physical harm), getting fired,
imprisoned, or bogged down in legal procedures for a long time.

Three unknown professors joined force to expose academia con artists via their
blog _Data Colada_. In my opinion they are taking a great risk to their career
doing so, but I admire their strategy and tactics:

> It was a routine takedown for the three scientists—Joe Simmons, Leif Nelson and Uri Simonsohn—who have gained academic renown for debunking published studies built on faulty or fraudulent data. They use tips, number crunching and gut instincts to uncover deception. Over the past decade, they have come to their own finding: Numbers don’t lie but people do.

### there is no such thing as "winning"

Despite all your efforts and good will, you will never "win" against
fraudsters, liers, and con artists.

You will become a thorn in their side. If you're not careful, you will probably
get hurt thru some form of retribution. Even if you are careful, like Harvard
Business School who led their own investigations before forcing Francesca Gino
out, the bad actors will first and foremost deny everything, they will adapt
their narrative to fit the lies, and they will use the legal system to lose as
little as possible from being outted.

### conclusion

This is why I'm a sucker for con artist stories: they are filled with wisdom
and life lessons.

First, we must refrain from blindly trusting people on the basis of their life
stories, scientific researches, and how confident they are. Of course we should
trust others, but we also should be prudent and verify the soundness of their
proposals. Especially for business leaders who have a strong influence on their
workforce. Basing an organization's core values on groundless, _air du temps_,
values can have a crucial impact its future success.

Don't judge a book by its cover. Just re-watch Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino's
Ted talks. Damn are they good! I would have trusted them with my first born.
But don't!

#### protect yourself and your career

Keep your distance from problematic people! Be pragmatic: outting a toxic
person might not be worth the risk, time, and effort. A most economical
strategy is keeping your distance from them. Why? Due to their lack of
integrity and the nature of their preoccupations, it is likely that they will
do you some harm: tarnish your reputation by association, use you as a cat paw,
etc.

Feeling cornered, don't expect a toxic person to respect your decision. They
usually will try to do some damage control and extract more informations from
you. Under the guise of a "constructive dialogue", you gonna lose precious
energy talking with them. Don't engage! Leave! Even though you were wrong
about the whole thing, a person with good faith would respect your decision and
not force you to engage in a distastul argument.

For example, when Dan Ariely was pressed to provide sources for a research, he
turned toward UCLA professor Aimee Drolet Rossi. By way of flattery ("I miss
our early days") and repeated emails, he tried to use her as a scapegoat for
his misgivings. 

Fortunately, she had the common sense of shutting him off after having
explained she never did any research for him:

- "Again, as I said last August, please keep me out of your mess. I will not
  be making any more statement with respect to this matter."
- "Don't contact me again"
