Against a commonly accepted ideology imposing self-actualisation and perpetual state of hustling as moral values, lays a calm principle layed upon a complete metaphysical system of the world.

Taoism states that ``non doing`` (Wu wei) is a fundamental principle of government and self-government. 

_Taoism_ is a philosophical tradition based on the writings of Chinese philosopher Laozi (4th century B.C.). The renowned book _Tao te Ching_ is described as the "book of the way and virtue". It proposes a metaphysical explanation of the origin of the world. An explanation of the principles ruling the world. Its teachings are aimed at the sage and the enlightened ruler. Against our commonly accepted values, it describes the best way to be effective : by doing as little as possible.

##### Tao Te Ching – Verse 60

> "Governing a large country
is like frying a small fish.
You spoil it with too much poking.
Center your country in the Tao
and evil will have no power.
Not that it isn’t there,
but you’ll be able to step out of its way.<br/><br/>
>
>Give evil nothing to oppose
and it will disappear by itself."
